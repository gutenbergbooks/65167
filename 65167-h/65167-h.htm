<p class="pcap">Throughout her life, Mrs. Edward A. Deeds was a lover of music.
By the time she had reached her early teens she was an accomplished
musician. From then until her passing in 1949, music
remained one of the dominant interests of her life. Her desire to
share the beauty of good music with others found expression in
many ways and culminated in her decision to erect a Carillon
which for generations to come would be a source of enjoyment
and relaxation for the people of this community. She saw this
dream fulfilled when on Easter Sunday in April, 1942, the Deeds
Carillon bells rang out in a program of Easter music. The beautiful
shaft with its thirty-two bells became a striking symbol of the
interest of Mrs. Deeds in music and in the community of which
she was so long a part.</p>

<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">The Deeds Carillon</span></h2>
<p>Carillon Park owes its existence to the generosity of two public-spirited
Dayton citizens, Colonel and Mrs. Edward A. Deeds. It is an
expression of the interests of two people expanded for the pleasure and
advancement of the entire community.</p>
<p>The Park had its inception with the Carillon, the gift of Mrs. Deeds.
Devoted to music from her girlhood, and herself an accomplished
musician, she had the inspiration for it while listening to the chimes in
one of the famous old belfries of Bruges. As the melodious notes fell on
her ears she said to herself, &ldquo;In no other way can simple and inspiring
music be spread among the entire populace.&rdquo; In that hour was born the
idea of the Deeds Carillon which rears its majestic height in the midst
of Carillon Park.</p>
<p>The idea of combining a group of bells to form a carillon dates back
to the Middle Ages. Since bells provided the world&rsquo;s oldest and most
simple form of musical expression there came the evolution from a call
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
to prayer to a musical program. Some of Europe&rsquo;s most famed and
beautiful towers have carillons. The carillon was developed to a greater
and more artistic extent in Belgium than in any other continental
country, not only in Bruges but also in Antwerp, Ghent, and Mechlin.
Around the carillon bells has been woven a tradition of beauty and
inspirational service.</p>

</div>
<p>Before embarking on her enterprise Mrs. Deeds viewed many carillons
at home and abroad and made a careful study of bells. The initial
requirement was to find a site which would provide the best ultimate
results from carillon music without echo and the jumbling of tone. Early
in her planning Mrs. Deeds considered Deeds Park at the junction of
the Miami River and Mad River. This park&mdash;a gift of Colonel Deeds
to the city of Dayton&mdash;would have made an appropriate setting. The
idea was reluctantly abandoned because of interfering noises and sound
deflection which would occur in the area. Finally Mrs. Deeds decided
upon a site in the triangular area located between Patterson Boulevard
and Carillon Boulevard almost adjacent to Old River, The National
Cash Register Company recreational park.</p>

<p>The sixty-one acres comprised
in Carillon Park represent a
notable piece of reclamation. For
many years it was periodically
flooded and became a bushy
swamp breeding mosquitoes and
germs. It was one of Dayton&rsquo;s eyesores in addition to being a menace
to health. The decision to build the Deeds Carillon led to its transformation.
Within a year the one-time &ldquo;dismal swamp&rdquo; emerged as an ideal
pleasure ground equipped with a parking space for hundreds of motor
cars. In this lovely, wooded, and verdant environment the citizens of
Dayton and all others who come, relax and enjoy the music of the
carillon bells.</p>
<p>Including both large and small examples, there were only six true
carillon towers in the United States prior to the construction of the
Deeds Carillon. Of these, two were on college grounds, two on private
estates, one in a cemetery, while the sixth was the one built by the late
Edward K. Bok on his Florida estate. A true carillon must have a
minimum of twenty-three bells providing the tones and semitones to
encompass the full octaves. Except in rare instances when they were
hung in the gabled arches of the old Spanish missions and outside oriental
temples, carillon bells are seldom seen. For hundreds of years
architects have struggled with the problem of providing structures to
support carillons which will elevate them to a height at which they can
be adequately heard over the surrounding countryside. The solution
had invariably been to erect an enclosed tower in which the bells are
hidden from view and covered with grilles which screen the bells from
sight and tend to muffle the sound.</p>

<p class="pcap">Hours of planning and consultation with architects and the bell casters
went into the building of the Deeds Carillon.</p>
</div>
<p>Starting with the instruction from Mrs. Deeds that the thirty-two
bells in the Deeds Carillon must all be exposed to view, the architects,
after long study and investigation, were able to carry out her wishes.
The Deeds Carillon is the first tower to have all the bells mounted
entirely in the open, thus insuring greater carrying power and purest,
unrestricted beauty of tone. Such a departure from the old method of
construction required a complete rechecking of the science of carillon
tower design and bell placement.</p>
<p>Like Colonel Deeds, Mrs. Deeds was a perfectionist. She visioned the
ideal structure, and the architects, Reinhard, Hofmeister &amp; Walquist of
New York, designers of Rockefeller Center, met every requirement.
The landscaping surrounding the tower was in the hands of Olmstead
Brothers of Boston, foremost in their field.</p>
<p>An unusual feature of the design is the so-called entasis of the sides
of the tower in which they were reduced toward the top as much as
eighteen inches, not in a straight line but by means of a curve which
bows three inches from top to bottom. The purpose of this is not to
make the sides bulge but to correct the optical illusion of pinching in
and actually making the sides look straight. This was the device employed
by the ancient Greeks for the same purpose in the design of
their classic columns.</p>

<p>The Carillon tower, built of granite, steel, and limestone, soars skyward
151 feet from the base planted on a green and friendly hill. It
is a shaft of precise beauty, dramatic in its simplicity, and terminating
in noble arches. Suspended from the cross-shaped intersections of the
arches, in full sight from all directions and visible for miles around, is
the chandelier of bells. At the base of the Carillon is the Console
Room. From here an elaborate electrical system plays the bells through
the touch of the operator&rsquo;s fingers at the console.</p>
<p>The actual ringing of the bells requires an unusual mechanism consisting
of an electrical solenoid, delivering a blow of proper force for
each size of bell. Suitable screens, designed so as not to interfere with
the sound, are placed at the bottom of the mechanism so that each bell,
when viewed from the ground, presents a uniform appearance, only the
clapper being visible. This was the first time that such a type of construction
in all its details had been followed, making possible a full, rich
beauty of tone.</p>

<p class="t0">And made forlorn the households born</p>
<p class="t0">Of peace on earth good will to men.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">And in despair I bowed my head</p>

<p class="t0">For hate is strong and mocks the song</p>
<p class="t0">Of peace on earth good will to men.</p>
</div>

<p class="t0">God is not dead nor does He sleep,</p>
<p class="t0">The wrong shall fail, the right prevail</p>
<p class="t0">With peace on earth good will to men.</p>
</div>
<p>The bells range in size from six feet in diameter with a weight of
7,000 pounds to the smallest one which is eighteen inches in diameter
weighing 250 pounds. Of the thirty-two bells in the Carillon, twenty-three
are speaking bells covering a range of two full octaves from B
flat below middle C. On the speaking bells were inscribed the names of
the Deeds family then living, while on the silent bells appear the names
of six deceased members.</p>

<p>The same loving care that was lavished on the planning of the
Carillon has found expression in the arrangement of the programs.
Mrs. Deeds personally supervised the selection and arrangement of more
than 400 musical selections so they could be played on the bells. The
music has been transferred to sheets of white Bristol paper bearing the
Carillon crest which are filed systematically for reference.</p>
<p>Thirty-five feet above the base of the Carillon tower is a balcony-like
structure in bronze which contains a room twelve feet in diameter
and six feet high. In this room are installed thirty-two powerful high-fidelity
speakers of the most advanced design. On Easter morning,
Christmas Eve, and other occasions, programs are broadcast directly
to the countryside. Recorded music, performed by the world&rsquo;s finest
bands, choruses, orchestras and soloists, is to be heard with all its beauty
for nearly a mile in every direction throughout the wide-open spaces
about the Carillon tower. This Celestron is not connected in any way
with the chandelier of bells of the Carillon. It is an additional instrument
for the pleasure of those who love good music.</p>
<p>The science of bell-making is an old one. Sometimes it is necessary
to cast twenty or thirty bells to fill an order for a ten-bell chime. The
Deeds Carillon bells were made by The Meneely Bell Company of
Troy, New York.</p>

<p>A most spectacular step in bell-making comes when the copper and
tin are melted and mixed in the oil furnace, brought to just the proper
temperature, and then carried in a huge ladle from which the molten
alloy is poured into the mold.</p>
<p>Larger bells are kept buried in dirt for days after the casting to
retard their cooling. Sometimes weeks go by before the bell can be
&ldquo;shaken out&rdquo; and the founder gets the final check on the accuracy of
his calculations.</p>
<p>The Meneely Bell Company foundry represented a curious mixture of
the old and the new. There was the main foundry with its large modern
oil melting furnaces in which was blended the age-old mixture of copper
and tin which is known in the textbooks as &ldquo;bell metal&rdquo;.... Out in
the next shop were the blacksmith and his helper, skillfully working iron
into the special bell mountings. Immediately behind this was the
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
finishing room where large and small bells were cleaned and buffed,
while finished ones were being set into their mountings for final tests
before shipment. Upstairs, patterns and cabinets were fashioned from
wood; while on a nearby drafting board a chime would take form as it
would fit into its final position in the tower.</p>
<p>In making bells, there must be a complete understanding of the technical
elements that make a bell ring true. Meneely&rsquo;s men knew that a
pure tone was a definite number of vibrations per second as sensed by
the human ear.</p>
<p>The sound of a single tone is pleasant but colorless. The usual tone is
made up of a number of different pure tones, blending together, with
the dominant one giving the tone its pitch. Practically everything that
will vibrate will produce a tone, but only certain combinations will have
the musical qualities which distinguish them from unpleasant &ldquo;noise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this country, the commonest form of chime is that found in clock
towers. Principally used to strike the quarters and hours, these bells are
usually stationary and seldom number more than four or five; hence
no complete airs can be played with them.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig16">

<p class="pcap">From an acoustical standpoint the Deeds Carillon is ideally located. The hills to the
south provide a natural sounding board and enhance the tone of the music.</p>
</div>
<p>Chimes usually contain a minimum of ten bells, which give enough
tones in the diatonic scale to permit the rendering of hundreds of complete
hymns, folk songs, etc., in simple harmonies. Chimes are typically
an American form of art and are found in our churches in every part
of the country. The bells do not move, but the clappers are operated
from manual claviers, or by modern electrical methods employing small
piano-like keyboards.</p>

<p>The first regularly scheduled Deeds Carillon program was presented
on Sunday, August 23, 1942, in the presence of a capacity crowd. The
first two programs were played by Mrs. Deeds. Since that inaugural
day, programs are given every Sunday afternoon, June through October,
and at Easter Sunrise.</p>
<p>Once Carillon Park had been created, Colonel Deeds stepped into the
picture for his contribution to the project. His wise counsel and sense
of perfection had contributed much to the success of the tower construction.
He now set about to gratify his love for the historic with the
larger conception of providing a group of exhibits that would be
a visual lesson in history. The striking parade of transportation in the
Park dating from the picturesque days of the Conestoga wagon and the
Concord coach to the Wright airplane is the result. Every exhibit meant
painstaking research and discriminating choice.</p>
<p>The Deeds Carillon stands on a three-acre tract purchased by Mrs.
Deeds from NCR. The property was, in turn deeded to Educational
and Musical Arts, Incorporated. This is an administrative subsidiary
of the Dayton Foundation, especially created to carry out the construction
and perpetuation plans through a group of Dayton&rsquo;s civic leaders
who were proud and glad to assume the responsibility. The financial
requirements for maintenance and operation are met through an endowment
fund created by Mrs. Deeds and contributions of Colonel Deeds.</p>
<p>Carillon Park is unique among the gifts for public enjoyment in that
it serves a threefold purpose. The Carillon itself, with its eloquent and
deep-toned bells, is a spiritual stimulant for Dayton, a source of beauty
and inspiration. The Park, a natural beauty spot, is a sanctuary for all
people, while the historical exhibits are highly educational.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
